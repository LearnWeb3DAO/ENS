# The Ethereum Name Service

## Background

When web initially started the only way you could explore information on the web was by entering in its IP address. Then the concept of DNS was introduced which helped us to link a domain name to an IP address.

So whenever you type `learnweb3.io`, DNS takes care of translating it to the respective IP which is what the computer finally understands.

## What is ENS?

- ENS stands for `The Ethereum Name Service` and it behaves very similar to how DNS behaves in the web2 space.
- As we all know that Ethereum has long addresses which are hard to remember or type
- ENS solves this issue by translating these wallet addresses, hashes etc into readable domains which are then saved on Ethereum blockchain
- The best part about ENS is unlike DNS servers which are centralized, ENS works with the help of a smart contract which is censorship resistant.
- So now when you are sending your wallet address to someone which looks like `0x1234huiahi....` you can actually send them `tom.eth` and the ENS would figure out that `tom.eth` is actually equal to your wallet address(`0x1234huiahi....`)

## Build

Its time to build something where we can use ENS.

## Requirements

Develop a website which can display the ENS for an address if it has one.

Lets gooo 🚀

## Setup

- First lets get an ENS name for your address, start by opening up [https://app.ens.domains/](https://app.ens.domains/)
- Make sure when you open the website, your MetaMask is connected to the `Rinkeby testnet` and it has some `Rinkeby Ether`

- Copy your discord username(including the 4 digit code) and remove the hashtag and click search
